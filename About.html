        <h1>ABOUT</h1>
            <p>Greetings &amp; thank you for landing here! I'm a retired airline industry professional</p>
            <p>Now attempting to produce &amp; direct a personal "second act" through entrepreneurship</p>
            <p>Currently, you'll find my small business on EBay under the name of 'Fly-paper'.  I specialize in back-issue aviation themed magazines</p>
            <p>Ultimately, once the instruction provided by CIS 132 is completed, I plan to transition some portion of my business to a stand-alone website</p>
            <p>Further, a stand-alone webpage will serve as an online resume' and introduction to my professional experience in the airline industry</p>
